Simple Client side consume ASP.NET Web API server

In some cases, you want to using ASP.NET Web API endpoint with a client. For example, you want HTTP is going to give you GET some data back or POST/PUT/DELETE data to server. This article, I use the HttpClient to comunicate between enpoint and client side.

The first, we create project ASP.NET WEB API, add NORTHWND db,  add Nuget Package AutoMapper at ServerAPI,  HttpClient, Newtonsoft.Json  at client side project, Mvc.Routing and other dependency.

The source code has 2 part: ServerAPI project for WEB API, ClientSide for client side call web api.
